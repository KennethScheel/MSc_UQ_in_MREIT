# MSc project - UQ in MREIT
Repository containing code written for my MSc project on Computational Uncertainty Quantification for parametrized Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography. This work is a collaboration with my thesis supervisors Babak Maboudi Afkham and Kim Knudsen from DTU Compute, Denmark.

Here you can find the MSc thesis itself as a .pdf file, along with the code used for producing the results for problem 0 and problem 2 in the thesis. The rest of the code can be shared upon request.  

The uploaded folders corresponds to the following problems from the thesis:
- Toy_problem_one_ball   $\leftrightarrow$   Problem 0: spherical inclusion with known conductivity
- Problem6_rotated_ellipsoid_detection   $\leftrightarrow$   Problem 2: rotated ellipsoidal inclusion with unknown conductivity

In each folder, the scrips with 2D in their names cover the pseudo-3D method and the scripts with 3D in their names cover the full-3D method.
