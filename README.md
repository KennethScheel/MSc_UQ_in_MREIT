# MSc project - UQ in MREIT
Repository containing code written for my MSc project on Computational Uncertainty Quantification for parametrized Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography.

All scripts for reproducing the results for problem 0 in the thesis. The scrips with 2D in their names cover the pseudo-3D method, and the scripts with 3D in their names cover the full-3D method.

The uploaded folders on GitHub corresponds to the following problems from the thesis:
 
Toy_problem_one_ball   <->   Problem 0: spherical inclusion with known conductivity
